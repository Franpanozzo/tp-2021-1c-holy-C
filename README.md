# A-MongOS Trabajo Pr√°ctico 2021-1C holy-C

A-MongOS is an Operating Systems project, in which we learned to make a shared library, create a communication protocol, manage memory to avoid memory leaks, using Ram Memory concepts with virtual memory such as paging and segmentation, as well as memory compaction and the concepts of internal and external fragmentation. On the other hand, thread synchronization is implemented using short-term scheduling algorithms such as Round Robin and FIFO, and finally an implementation of a File System to be able to persist the data.
